I am a research assistant in the Human Genomics & Evolution Lab at SVI, currently working on the validation and multi-omic characterisation of a panel of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from Papua New Guinea, an underrepresented group in existing genomic data and public cell line collections. 

Previously, I have completed a Bachelor of Biomedicine with Honours, majoring in Cell & Developmental Biology, and more recently a Graduate Certificate of Science Communication.
