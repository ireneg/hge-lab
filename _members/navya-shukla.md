I'm a PhD student studying the convergent evolution of the extinct Tasmanian Tiger and Eutherian canids such as wolves, using comparative and functional genomic techniques. As a "damp" lab biologist, with skills in both the wet lab (molecular biology and cell culture) and bioinformatic analyses. I have extensive experience working on high-throughput Massively Parallel Reporter Assays. 

I've previously also done a honours project and undergraduate work in the Gallego Romero Lab, looking at genetic diversity in chimpanzee transcriptomic samples.
