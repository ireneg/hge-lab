# Human Genomics and Evolution group at SVI

We study the ways in which natural selection and evolution have shaped humans, in order to understand how our species' past defines our present.  We are particularly interested in understanding both the causes and the consequences of differences in gene expression and regulation across human populations, and explore these questions through multiple complementary approaches, working with everything from human communities in the field to *in vitro* models in the laboratory. By combining the power of functional genomics with the versatility of induced pluripotent stem cells with we address questions about the mechanisms of evolutionary adaptation in humans that are intractable by any other means.

We are based at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, a biomedical research institute in Melbourne, Australia, and have strong links to the University of Melbourne's Schools of Medical, Dental and Health Sciences, and Biosciences. 

We are always looking for enthusiastic people to join the lab. If you are interested in pursuing an Masters or PhD degree with us, or an undergrad in your final year, contact Irene and weâ€™ll go from there.
