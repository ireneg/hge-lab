Below you can find a list of all of our publications. We are committed to carrying out high quality reproducible research, be that computational or molecular biology based. To that end we make source code and all data and protocols available on publication. Code repos should be available either [here](gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/igr-lab) (older projects) or [here](gitlab.svi.edu.au/igr-lab) (newer projects), and large data dumps associated with specific papers are on our [figshare account](https://figshare.unimelb.edu.au/authors/IRENE_GALLEGO_ROMERO/4359202). If you cannot find something, [get in touch](contact).
